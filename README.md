# Translate-WordPress-Slider-Revolution

WP Slider Revolution has WPML support but lack of native Polylang support. This code snippet is to fake that the WPML plugin is loaded and the slider revolution will enable all the translation functions and allow users to translate sliders without the WPML plugin.

Required Plugin: Polylang
